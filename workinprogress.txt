A textfile with various notes to whoever else is interested 
in what's coming down the pike and possibly what they could do:

Several device drivers are already done and coded. The codebase is stable enough that
more can be added easily enough. So, one of the big things to do right now is to
find new devices and support them.

However, really only some sorts of devices are stable and supported. Motor controllers,
throttles, brakes are all fairly mature. BMS systems and chargers, not so much.

Wifi works and bluetooth devices are somewhat supported as well. OBDII support has been
added over wifi and bluetooth but there is still work to do in making the interface
more robust and generic. Also, canbus based OBDII still has to be fixed up.
